# Game Picker
uh, hi. i made this to help you decide what games to play!

## How to use
**RECOMMENDED WITH STEAM ONLY**

Alright to use this, you select "common" within steams files.

Heres an example path: C:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common

This works by looking at all the game folders and scanning them to find the exe file they have. (Does not check sub folders so don't worry about it picking ms c++ installs, etc)

**Sometimes it may pick a games crash handler, idk how to fix this**
